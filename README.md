# PPD-BAN_CALC
A redirect to a VERY simple and crude calculator I made for a buddy who is into cryptocurrency.

==============================
A friend of mine is into FoldingAtHome which is basically a distributed super computer where anyone can download the FAH Client and fold proteins for medical science. 
Attached to that, there's a group of people who developed a cryptocurrency as a reward for Folding, called Banano. This simple calculator takes the estimated Points-Per-Day 
from the FAH Client and gives you a (pretty close) estimate of your daily Banano payout.
